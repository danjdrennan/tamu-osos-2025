# TAMU OSOS 2025

Materials for the modules on

- Introduction to Python (Trevor Millnar)
- Python for Data Science (Dan Drennan)

Taught at Texas A&M's OSOS 2025 seminar in College Station, TX.

## Python for Data Science


### Learning outcomes

1. How to load and examine data  (use data loaders)
2. Basic data exploration   (shapes, summary stats, simple plots)
3. Simple statistical tests (t-tests, correlations, linear regression)
4. Making publication-ready figures (scatter plots, bar plots with error bars)
5. Reproducible workflows (scripts versus notebooks, documentation)

Reproducibility: Fingerprinting / checksums

- only hash inputs and data
- get git info as part of the hash
- show how to get patches for the relevant pieces of your code

### Upload documents

Upload docs to

- [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1DvTzzytLlg3ZnBIKHKbGk8AGGeR3iiQq)

Provide some outline of learning outcomes/learning goals together with GitHub
link in a Google Doc.

### Lecturing

Could use this Etherpad thing to assist people with troubleshooting or for
community chatter.

There are similar chat interfaces available from [hack.chat](hack.chat) which
would look more like a stream chat.
