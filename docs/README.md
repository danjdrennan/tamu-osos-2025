# Tools

After completing this seminar you will have learned to use Python by following
along with brief introductory documents. If we've done our jobs well then you
will be inspired to adopt Python as part of your workflow for your research.

The easiest path forward is to use cloud tools like Google Colab or GitHub's
devcontainers. This works well for a while, but eventually you will want to
develop locally. This directory is the extended cut with recommendations on how
to make that process as painless as possible.
