# High performance computing

Students and trainees at Texas A&M have access to several high performance
computing (HPC) environments, often simply referred to as clusters. These
clusters provide access to powerful compute nodes with much better hardware than
you're likely to have in your home or department, including some support for
running large neural network models on distributed GPUs. You can learn more
about Texas A&M's cluster from their [official webpage](https://hprc.tamu.edu/)
and view tutorials from their excellent [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@TexasAMHPRC).

## Commercial offerings

If you find yourself needing more compute or paid resources off campus for some
reason, then you may also want to look at

* Amazon Web Services
* Google Cloud Platforms
* Kaggle (a data science platform)
* Microsoft Azure

All of these grant some amount of educational credits for students and
educators, and large compute nodes are available also.

## Working with sensitive data

Depending on your research area, your data may have HIPAA or US Census data or
other confidentiality requirements. In that case you will be limited in the
commercial offerings you are able to use for your work. However, the HPRC staff
are well equipped to support this kind of work, and would be helpful to consult
with early.

If you are planning to conduct studies where you will collect data with these
kinds of restrictions but you intend to use an HPC, you should start consulting
early with staff from the HPRC or IT or whoever you work with in an IRB.
